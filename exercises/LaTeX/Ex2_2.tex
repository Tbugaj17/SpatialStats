\section{Exercise 1}
Consider a Poisson process $X$, on the unit square, with intensity function $\rho(x,y)=400y$. 
Calculate the mean number of points.\\
Which of the following point patterns could reasonably be a simulation of $X$. 
Which Poisson processes could the others be coming from?

\section{Exercise 2}
An insurance agent is trying to estimate the number of car accidents paid
by the insurance company during a given year. Let $t\in [0,12)$ denote
time during the year and assume an inhomogeneous Poisson process of
car accidents on this interval with intensity function
\[
\rho(t)=
\begin{cases}
    \alpha, \quad if\  t<3\  \text{or}\ t\geq 10\\
    \beta, \quad if\  3\leq t < 10,
\end{cases}
\]
where $\alpha > \beta$ due to the possibility of slippery roads.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Using this model, find the mean number of car accidents in the Spring 

    

\end{enumerate}
